# Contributing Guidelines

There are many ways to contribute to this project.

## Opening an issue

You can [open an issue](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-pallet-abstractions/issues/new/choose) to suggest a feature or report a bug.

Before opening an issue, be sure to search through the existing open and closed
issues, and consider posting a comment in one of those instead.

When requesting a new feature, include as many details as you can, especially
around the use cases that motivate it. Features are prioritized according to
the impact they may have on the ecosystem, so we appreciate information showing
that the impact could be high.

## Submitting a pull request

If you would like to contribute code or documentation you may do so by forking
the repository and submitting a pull request.

Any non-trivial code contribution must be first discussed with the maintainers
in an issue. Only very minor changes are accepted without prior discussion.

Make sure to run linter and tests to make sure your pull request is good before submitting it.

If you're looking for a good place to start, look for issues labelled
["good first issue"].
